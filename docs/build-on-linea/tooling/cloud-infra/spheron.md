# Spheron Network

## What is Spheron?

[Spheron](https://spheron.network/) is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) designed for dapps looking to launch their applications on decentralized infrastructure with optimal performance, and provides compute capabilities, decentralized storage, CDN and web hosting out of the box. With its comprehensive set of tools and services rooted in web3 infrastructure provision, Spheron empowers developers to meet the dynamic demands of the digital landscape. Its exceptional performance not only rivals web2 counterparts but also showcases the potential of web3 technology for the next generation of applications.

## How to deploy a static site on Spheron

Deploying static apps on Spheron is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. **Connect your Git provider:**<br/> Connecting your Git provider allows Spheron to sync your repositories and trigger deployments whenever new updates are made. Spheron supports the following [Git providers](https://docs.spheron.network/static/deployment/logs/): Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket.

2. **Set up your project:**<br/> Create a new project on Spheron and choose your desired app repository for deployment.

3. **Select deployment protocol:**<br/> Select the desired protocol for hosting your static app. Spheron supports **Arweave**, **Filecoin**, and **IPFS**.

4. **Configure deployment settings:**<br/> Spheron will automatically detect and configure most of these settings for you, though you have to [add environment variables](https://docs.spheron.network/static/projects/variables/) in the dedicated section. If needed, modify the remaining parameters according to your requirements. That includes selecting the framework, branch, root directory, build and output settings, and the node engine.

5. **Trigger deployment:**<br/> After configuring all the required settings, initiate the deployment process. Spheron will fetch your code, build the static files, and deploy them to your specified protocol.

6. **Access your app:**<br/> Once the deployment is complete, you can access your app through the domain generated by Spheron. You also have the option to [set up a custom domain](https://docs.spheron.network/static/projects/domain/) for your app.

## How to upload to IPFS using Spheron SDK

### 1. Spheron Storage SDK (for Nodejs environments)

### Installation

```sh
npm i @spheron/storage
```

### Usage

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

const client = new SpheronClient({ token });

let currentlyUploaded = 0;

const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await client.upload(
  filePath,
  {
    protocol: ProtocolEnum.IPFS,
    name,
    onUploadInitiated: (uploadId) => {
      console.log(`Upload with id ${uploadId} started...`);
    },
    onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
      currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
      console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
    },
  },
);
```

> Checkout our [Storage SDK Documentation](https://docs.spheron.network/sdk/storage-v2/) for more info.

### 2. Spheron Browser Upload SDK (for Browser environments)

### Installation

```sh
npm i @spheron/browser-upload
```

### Usage

**Server**

You have to set up a web server with an endpoint that will be used by the frontend to fetch the token for upload.

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

...

app.get("/initiate-upload", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const bucketName = "example-browser-upload"; // use your preferred name
    const protocol = ProtocolEnum.IPFS; // use your preferred protocol
    const token = process.env.SPHERON_TOKEN; // add your access token in .env or paste it here

    const client = new SpheronClient({ token });

    const { uploadToken } = await client.createSingleUploadToken({
      name: bucketName,
      protocol,
    });

    res.status(200).json({
      uploadToken,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    next(error);
  }
});
```

**Client**

You have to send a request to your server to create the uploadToken that will be used to upload files from the browser.

```js
import { upload } from "@spheron/browser-upload";

...

const response = await fetch(`<BACKEND_URL>/initiate-upload`); // get the temporary access token from server
const resJson = await response.json();
const token =  resJson.uploadToken;

let currentlyUploaded = 0;

const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await upload(files, {
  token,
  onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
    currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
    console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
  },
});

...
```

## How to create and deploy apps using Spheron CLI

## Installation

### For Mac and Linux

To install the Spheron CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo npm install -g @spheron/cli
```

### For Windows

To install the Spheron CLI, open your terminal in administrator mode and run the following command:

```
npm install -g @spheron/cli
```

## Usage

### `spheron init`

The `spheron init` command allows you to initialize a new Spheron project. A `spheron.json` file is created in your current path that describes your project. It will be utilized by the `spheron publish` command.

### Usage

```sh
spheron init
```

Upon running this command, a prompter will appear that will allow you to select protocol, add project name, add path, and select framework. Here is how it will look:

```sh
? Project name: (Code)
? Upload protocol: (Use arrow keys)
  Arweave
  Filecoin
‚ùØ IPFS
```

### `spheron publish`

The `spheron publish` command allows you to upload your project using the configuration that is described in the `spheron.json` file of your project.

#### Usage

```sh
spheron publish
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure that you create a production build before running the `spheron
  publish` command.
</Callout>

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Spheron CLI 1.0.7

Publishing your dapp to IPFS üöÄ
Uploading directory build
Upload started, ID of deployment: 643fce207c3c7a0012df33a7

## How to view and retrieve content from IPFS using Spheron

### Dedicated IPFS Gateways

[Dedicated gateways](https://docs.spheron.network/gateways/dedicated/) are IPFS gateways specifically designed to enhance access to pinned content across the network by offering faster speeds and increased rate limits.

Using dedicated gateways offers several benefits:

- Improved speed
- Increased rate limits
- White-labeling gateway
- Serve content from any IPFS node

### Create a Dedicated Gateway

Follow these steps to create a dedicated gateway:

1. Log in to Spheron and navigate to the **Gateways** section in the navbar.
2. Click **Generate** to create a new gateway.
3. Enter a name for your gateway and click **Create**.

### How to Use Your Gateway

To access content through your dedicated gateway, simply follow these steps:

1. Obtain the CID (content identifier) of the file you wish to view.
2. Append the CID to your gateway URL in the following format:

```
https://{gateway-name}.spheron.link/ipfs/{cid}
```

> Checkout our [gateway documentation](https://docs.spheron.network/gateways/dedicated/) for more information.

# Axelar Network

The [Axelar Network](https://docs.axelar.dev/), is a blockchain of blockchains that allows for universal web3 interoperability. By integrating with Axelar, your Linea-based application now has access to the [45+ chains](https://axelarscan.io/) that are also connected via Axelar. As Axelar is a blockchain of blockchains it overcomes many of the challenges of more centralized interoperability solutions; transactions that go through the Axelar network cannot be censored by any oracle, relayer, or sequencer.

## Available Functionality

Axelar enables powerful interchain features for builders on Linea.

1. The ability to [send tokens](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/send-tokens/overview) across blockchains
1. The ability to send [general messages](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/overview) across blockchains

## Linea Integration

When integrating with Axelar there are two key contracts that need to be utilized. These are:

1. The [Axelar Gateway](https://docs.axelar.dev/learn#gateway-smart-contracts)
   - On the source chain, this contract exposes the functions which you will use to initiate an interchain transaction.
   - On the destination chain, this contract enables messages to be executed automatically to complete the interchain transaction.
1. The [Axelar Gas Service](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/gas-services/intro)
   - This contract is the entrypoint into Axelar's gas service, which handles gas payment for your transaction on both the Axelar network and the destination chain. You as the caller now only need the gas of the source chain.

### Contract Addresses:

| Contract | Network | Address | networkId |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway | Mainnet | [0xe432150cce91c13a887f7D836923d5597adD8E31](https://lineascan.build/address/0xe432150cce91c13a887f7D836923d5597adD8E31) | 59144 |
| Gateway | Testnet | [0xe432150cce91c13a887f7D836923d5597adD8E31](https://goerli.lineascan.build/address/0xe432150cce91c13a887f7D836923d5597adD8E31) | 59140 |
| Gas Service | Mainnet | [0x2d5d7d31F671F86C782533cc367F14109a082712](https://lineascan.build/address/0x2d5d7d31F671F86C782533cc367F14109a082712) | 59144 |
| Gas Service | Testnet | [0xbE406F0189A0B4cf3A05C286473D23791Dd44Cc6](https://goerli.lineascan.build/address/0xbE406F0189A0B4cf3A05C286473D23791Dd44Cc6) | 59140 |

Once you have submitted your transaction, you can view it on the [Axelarscan block explorer](https://axelarscan.io/). The Axelarscan explorer is specifically tailored to show your interchain transaction step by step as it passed from the source chain, via the Axelar network, to the destination chain.

## Axelar Use Cases

For inspiration, here are some live use cases demonstrating the kind of interchain applications that can be built on top of Axelar:

1. Interchain token swaps (e.g. [Squid](https://app.squidrouter.com/))

   - Squid is an exciting new protocol built on top of Axelar that allows users to swap tokens with a Uniswap-like experience, leveraging Axelar for swaps between tokens across different blockchains. Squid takes DeFi to the next level, reducing the need to revert to centralized exchanges or multiple different exchanges to swap tokens across chains.

1. Interchain lending (e.g. [Prime Protocol](https://www.primeprotocol.xyz/))

   - A chain-agnostic prime brokerage that allows users to deposit assets from any connected chain and use their aggregate value as collateral for loans on any other connected chain. Prime offers the ability to build interchain applications that connect from any blockchain to any other blockchain, rather than just connecting a series of blockchains to Ethereum. Prime's interchain design allows for a variety of new DeFi use cases, including cross-chain margining.

1. Interchain gaming (e.g. [Junkyard](https://junkyard.wtf/))

   - Web3 gaming is heavily reliant on NFTs, and enabling NFTs to be passed between blockchains is a critical next step for NFT-based games. Junkyard leverages Axelar to allow interchain NFTs in its game. In Junkyard, players can deposit their NFTs to the Junkyard contract. The NFT can come from any chain connected to the Axelar ecosystem, including Linea.

# Toolkit for NFT Accounts on Linea

GroupOS by [Station](https://station.express) is a web3 toolkit designed to create and coordinate values-aligned networks in new ways. Accounts, the core module of GroupOS, is the easiest way for organizations to create programmatic NFT wallets, incentivize users, and measure growth.

Powered by ERC-6551 and ERC-4337. Gasless. Signatureless.

## Use Cases

Accounts enables organizations to fully leverage the potential of NFTs for capturing members' identities in higher fidelity, unlocking brand new ways to engage and monetize.

- **Membership loyalty and rewards:** Create flexible and robust gamification and rewards systems where users can earn and exchange points and collectibles. Reward your most loyal and early users with exclusive access to product features or experiences.
- **Interoperable profile (”Passport”):** Create a portable and expressive identity system that grants users control over their digital identity and reputation, enhancing user autonomy and reducing platform integration overhead and reliance on third-party entities.
- **Gasless onboarding:** GroupOS enables gasless and user-friendly onboarding through NFT-bound accounts (ERC-6551) and account abstraction (ERC-4337) standards. This allows organizations to bring in new members without gas fees while receiving a personalized and expressive experience with NFTs.

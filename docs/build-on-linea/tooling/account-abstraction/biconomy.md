# Superpowers for your Web3 stack

The Biconomy SDK provides solutions for decentralized applications (dapps) that streamline and simplify tasks from onboarding to user engagement while respecting self-custody. It is a one-stop solution to enable an effortless experience in your dapp: it eases onboarding for new users and abstracts away transaction complexities that your users face on a daily basis. This is enabled by using Smart Contract Wallets (SCW) built on top of our multi-chain Relayer Infrastructure.
